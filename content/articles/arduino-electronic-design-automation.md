Summary: Electronic design automation (EDA or ECAD) is a category of software tools for designing electronic systems such as printed circuit boards. I explore here what exists for the Arduino world.  

Electronic design automation (EDA or ECAD) is a category of software tools for designing electronic systems such as printed circuit boards.  In my professional life, I have been work apart from this domain, and only now because of renewed interest in electronics, I have come back to do some research.  I was pleasantly amazed by what I found.
<h2>Schematic and PCB Layout Editors</h2>
EAGLE (Easily Applicable Graphical Layout Editor) is a very popular (and free) solution for PCB design, including Schematic Capture, Board Layout and Autorouter.

Other tools are specifically focused on the Arduino that allows users to document their prototypes, share them with others, teach electronics in a classroom, and to create a PCB layout for professional manufacturing.

<h2>PCB Board Creation</h2>
You can crate printed circuit board (PCB) with the aid of some web sites.  You submit your PCB design; they add your design to the batch of orders. When the batch is big enough, the batch is set off to be manufactured.

<h2>SPICE</h2>
SPICE (Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis) is a general-purpose, open source analog electronic circuit simulator
