Summary: I capture here some diagrams and descriptions of the Raspberry Pi hardware design to make it easy to referance.

The Raspberry Pi is a small, barebones computer developed by The <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi Foundation</a>, a UK nonprofit, with the intention of providing low-cost computers and free software to students. Their ultimate goal is to foster computer science education and they hope that this small, affordable computer will be a tool that enables that.

What has sparked my interest in the RPi is the fact that it a full functioning linux board, requires minimal peripheral to operate, engineered to support hardware hacking, and cost only $35 (only $25 if your willing to drop the Ethernet port and reduce the memory).

I'm posting here some links to specs for the RPi hardware for latter reference:
