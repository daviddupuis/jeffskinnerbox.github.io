## The Back Story
[Emoji][02] (絵文字 or えもじ; Japanese pronunciation: [emodʑi])
are the ideograms or smileys used in Japanese electronic messages and webpages,
whose use is spreading outside Japan.
The characters are used much like ASCII emoticons or kaomoji,
but a wider range is provided, and the icons are standardized and built into the handsets.

I found this [here][01].

#### Block Quotes
Here is an example of a block quote:

>_An operant conditioning chamber permits experimenters to study behavior conditioning (training) by teaching a subject animal to perform certain actions (like pressing a lever) in response to specific stimuli, such as a light or sound signal. When the subject correctly performs the behavior, the chamber mechanism delivers food or another reward. In some cases, the mechanism delivers a punishment for incorrect or missing responses. For instance, to test how operant conditioning works for certain invertebrates, psychologists use a device known as a "heat box"._
