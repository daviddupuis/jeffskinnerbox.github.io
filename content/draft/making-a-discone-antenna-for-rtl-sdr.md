Like all radio devices, to make optimal use of the RTL-SDR, a good antenna is need.
The 145mm [monopole antenna][41] that comes with my [NooElec R820T SDR & DVB-T][40] dongle
is not at all appropriate for the wide range of things I wish to do with this device.
A [discone antenna][42] is a good general antenna for the RTL-SDR as they are extremely wideband,
and should be useful over most of RTL-SDR's tuneable range.
There are several good sources for designing a discone antenna, some of better are listed below:

* [Home Made Coat Hanger Discone](http://www.rtl-sdr.com/home-made-coat-hanger-discone/)
* [VE3SQB ANTENNA DESIGN PROGRAMS](http://www.ve3sqb.com/)
* [Discone Antenna Calculator](http://www.changpuak.ch/electronics/calc_11.php)
* [PRACTICAL ANTENNA DESIGN: 140-150 MHZ VHF TRANSCEIVERS](http://files.radioscanner.ru/files/download/file311/practical_antenna_design.pdf)
* [White Paper: Discone Antenna Design](http://www.hipoint.ca/whitepapers/WhitePaper_DisconeAntenna.pdf)
* [Notes on HF Discone Antennas](http://w4rnl.net46.net/download/discone.pdf)

With the exception of "Notes on HF Discone Antennas",
these sources lack any rigorous analysis of what performance can be expected from the discone antenna
and how it might compare to the simple antenna that comes with the RTL-SDR.
For example, I couldn't find basic things like a [radiation patttern][43] for the discone antenna.
In this posting I set out to perform this analysis on my DIY discone antenna.
In doing this, I start out with a short, high-level tutorial on the core electromagnetic principles
related to antenna design and build up to the analysis and my antennas final physical specifications.

## The Electromagnetic Spectrum
[Radio frequency (RF)][01] or [radio spectrum][02] refers to the part of the [electromagnetic spectrum][03] frequencies lower than around 300 GHz (or, equivalently, wavelengths longer than about 1 mm).
Electromagnetic waves in this frequency range, called [radio waves][04], can travel through the earths atmosphere with ease and are used for [radio communication][05] and various other technologies.
Above 300 GHz, the absorption of electromagnetic radiation by Earth's atmosphere is so great that the atmosphere is effectively opaque, until it becomes transparent again in the near-infrared and optical window frequency ranges.

![em opacity](img/posts/jekyll-posts/atmospheric_electromagnetic_opacity.png, "Electromagnetic transmittance, or opacity, of the Earth's atmosphere")

The Earth's atmosphere stops most types of electromagnetic radiation from space from reaching Earth's surface. This illustration shows how far into the atmosphere different parts of the EM spectrum can go before being absorbed. Only portions of radio and visible light reach the surface. 

![em absorption](img/posts/jekyll-posts/em_absorption.jpg, "Electromagnetic absorption by the Earth's atmosphere")

Electromagnetic Spectrum

| Name | Wavelength | Frequency (Hz) | Photon Energy (eV) |
|:----:|:----------:|:--------------:|:------------------:|
| Gamma Ray | less than 0.01 nm | more than 30 EHz | 124 keV – 300+ GeV |
| X-Ray | 0.01 nm – 10 nm | 30 EHz – 30 PHz | 124 eV – 124 keV |
| Ultraviolet | 10 nm – 380 nm | 30 PHz – 790 THz | 3.3 eV – 124 eV |
| Visible | 380 nm – 700 nm | 790 THz – 430 THz | 1.7 eV – 3.3 eV |
| Infrared | 700 nm – 1 mm | 430 THz – 300 GHz | 1.24 meV – 1.7 eV |
| Microwave | 1 mm – 1 meter | 300 GHz – 300 MHz | 1.24 µeV – 1.24 meV |
| Radio | 1 mm – 100,000 km | 300 GHz – 3 Hz | 12.4 feV – 1.24 meV |

>Note: frequency x wavelength = 299,792,458 m/s (speed of light in vacuum).
1 eV (electron volt) is a unit of energy equal amount of energy gained (or lost) by the charge of a single electron moved across an electric potential difference of one volt.
[For comparisons][39], one trillion electronvolts  (1 Tev) about the kinetic energy of a flying mosquito and
6.24×10^20 eV is consumed by a single 100-watt light bulb in one second.

## The Radio Spectrum
It is within the Radio and Microwave sections of the electromagnetic spectrum,
where the absorption by the atmosphere is minimal,
mankind has discoved how it can be uses for [radio or wireless][05] transmission of signals.
Naturally occurring radio waves are also made by lightning, or by astronomical objects.
Man-made radio waves are used for fixed and mobile radio communication, broadcasting,
radar, navigation systems, communications satellites, computer networks, and innumerable other applications.
Different frequencies of radio waves have different propagation characteristics in the Earth's atmosphere:

* long waves may cover a part of the Earth very consistently
* shorter waves can reflect off the ionosphere and travel around the world
* much shorter wavelengths bend or reflect very little and travel on a line of sight.

To prevent [interference][08] between different users, the artificial generation and use of radio waves is strictly regulated by law,
and coordinated by an international body called the [International Telecommunications Union (ITU)][09]
and the [Federal Communications Commission (FCC)][10] within the United States.
World wide, the radio spectrum is divided into a number of [radio bands][02] on the basis of frequency, allocated to different broad uses.
Within a region of the world, further regulation is applied to the spectrum.
For example, within the United States, the FCC is responsible for the [allocation of radio spectrum][11] for specific uses, power levels, area of usage, etc.
This process is sometimes called [spectrum management][12],
where a bands or small section of the spectrum of radio communication frequencies are set aside for the same purpose.
Each of these bands has a basic [bandplan][07] which dictates how it is to be used and shared, to avoid interference and to set protocol for the compatibility of transmitters and receivers.

| Band Name | Abbreviation | ITU Band | Frequency / Wavelength | Example Uses |

The very specific frequency bands and their usage can be refined further.
Governance agencies like the [Federal Communications Commission (FCC)][10]
for commercial and consumers, and the [National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA)][54]
for Federal agencies (among other Federial ageancies) maintain databases of how these frequencies are used.
The FCC's database can be found [here][56] and the NTIA's database is [here][55].

## Creation of Radio Waves
While there are multiple source of [naturally occurring radio waves][49],
conveniently, radio frequency waves are invariably created by changing an electrical current in a wire.
This creates an [electromagnetic field][13] (also EMF or EM field) 
that varies in a defined fashion with the changing electrical current.
The physics of electromagnetism require that parts of this varying field to propagate as a wave,
which is called [electromagnetic radiation][15] (EM radiation or EMR),
are detected by placing a wire in the field, and detecting the electricity [induced][14] in the wire.
The wire is known as an [antenna][16], and is a [transducer][52] that converts electrical energy within the conductive antenna structure and interfaces with free space, delivering electromagnetic energy.
An antenna can be any shape or size,
and for a practical application can be a simple wire or a very sophisticated apparatus.

The antenna (or aerial) is an electrical device which converts electric power
into electromagnetic radiation (e.g. radio waves), and vice versa. 
Antennas are usually used with a [radio transmitter][17] or [radio receiver][18],
and when combined, the device is called a [transceiver][21].
In transmission, a radio transmitter supplies an oscillating radio frequency electric current to the antenna's terminals, and the antenna radiates the energy from the current as electromagnetic waves (radio waves).
In reception, an antenna intercepts some of the power of an electromagnetic wave in order to produce a tiny voltage at its terminals, that is applied to a receiver to be amplified.

The Radio Frequency spectrum is a somewhat variable part of the Electromagnetic
Spectrum that tends to grow as technology find better ways make transmission at higher and higher
frequencies better. At the lower end, the Radio Frequency spectrum is limited by the size of antennas
required to transmit the waves

We aimed at 110 Mhz, as 115 Mhz+ is where planes and other air traffic services tend to broadcast; lots of other cool things seem to talk on these frequencies too. Very little seems to sit around 100 Mhz and below that the military seems to start appearing.

## Electromagnetic Field
An [electromagnetic field][13] (also EMF or EM field) is a [physical field][51] produced by electrically charged objects.
The EMF affects the behavior of charged objects in the vicinity of the field.
The field can be viewed as the combination of an electric field and a magnetic field and cut across one another at right angles.
The electric field the surrounds the charges,
and the magnetic field is created by moving charges (currents).
Though the fields exist around the charged object, they propagate away from the charged object perpendicular to the two fields. 
At some point beyond the charged object, the fields detach themselves and propagate independently. In fact, they support and regenerate one another along the way.
This “independent” wave is electromagnetic radiation, and when it frequency is less than 300GHz its called a radio wave.
Radiation is energy (sometimes called [radiant energy][50]) that travels
and is the mechanisms by which energy can enter or leave a system.

The radiant energy is associated with only the parts of the electromagnetic field that radiate into infinite space.
This radiant energy decrease in intensity by an inverse-square law of power, so that the total radiation energy that crosses through an imaginary spherical surface is the same, no matter how far away from the antenna the spherical surface is drawn.
This energy has left the antenna system, propagates outward, decreasing in intensity (i.e. quantity of energy per surface unit) but the total quantity is constant.

As it turns out, an electromagnetic field’s characteristics differ depending on the distance from the antenna.
These different field characteristics are typically divided into two regions — the [near field and far field][53].
Part of the field, the "near-field" close to the transmitter, is part of the changing electromagnetic field, but does not count as electromagnetic radiation.
The far field is the propagating radiant energy described above and the field portion we are most interested in.
For more on electromagnetic near fields and far fields, see:

* [Antenna Field Regions](http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/smt-gst.nsf/eng/sf10112.html)

## Typical Antenna Designs
[monopole antenna][41]
[discone antenna][42]

Most of the antenna designs described are all suitable for work requiring a relatively
narrow band of frequencies with an omni-directional pattern of radiation.
Also in the mechanical viewpoint, these designs are simple and easy to construct which
makes them very popular among radio operators.
However all of them have a limited bandwidth of 140-150 MHz.
If one attempts to operate  these antennas
outside these frequency limits with a wideband transceiver, the
signal response becomes weaker as the operating frequency of the transceiver 
is moved farther away from the optimal operational band of the antenna.
At the same time the SWR in the transmission line increases and can reach an
intolerable point which may cause damage to the transceiver.
Although this limitation can be overcome by using a different antenna tuned to a different frequency band,
the process of changing antennas every time you
change your operating band becomes cumbersome or completely impractical.

This problem can be solved by using a broadband antenna, meaning an antenna that operates efficiently over a
wide range of frequencies.
There are several such broadband antenna designs, but we'll focus on one of these, the discone antenna.
Theoretically, a properly designed discone antenna can operate up to a frequency 10 times the value of its lowest operational frequency.
Specifically speaking, if a discone antenna is designed to operate with a lowest operational frequency of 140 MHz,
then it can be conveniently used up to 1.4 Gigahertz!
The lowest operational frequency is called cut-off frequency.
Below this frequency the SWR will increase rapidly.

## Driving the Antenna
When transmitting (or receiving) a radio signal via an antenna, you often have to consider
the wave nature of the radio signal because multiple wave cycles will be present within the body
of the current caring wire, called a [transmission line][22].
When not considered, the energy tends to radiate off the cable as radio waves, causing power losses.
In radio engineering, a transmission line is a specialized cable or other structure
designed to carry alternating current of radio frequency, that is, currents with a frequency high enough that their wave nature must be taken into account. 
Transmission lines must be used when the frequency is high enough that the wavelength of the waves begins to approach the length of the cable used.

## Fundamental Antenna Parameters
Antennas are characterized by a number of performance measures which a user would be concerned with in selecting or designing an antenna for a particular application.
To establish the key figures of merit for an antenna, you first must establish a reference point from which all antennas can be compared.
That reference point is the [isotopic antenna][23].
An isotropic radiator is a theoretical point source of electromagnetic waves which
radiates the same intensity of radiation in all directions.
It has no preferred direction of radiation.
It radiates uniformly in all directions over a sphere centered on the source.
Radio wave isotropic radiators cannot really exist, but are used conceptually as reference radiators with which other sources are compared.

You can thing of an antenna as a transformer of the energy carried by a transmission line and to energy delivered into free space.
To describe an antenna, we must characterize its properties as a transmission line load (input impedance)
and the distribution of the electromagnetic energy that it radiates into space (radiation pattern).
There are a number of key parameters and concepts that we can use to describe the antenna's "transforming" properties.
A discription for some of these parameters is given below:

* [Radiation Pattern][43] - Some times called the antenna pattern or far-field pattern, this is a plot of the gain as a function of direction and will varies with wavelength. In most case, the radiation pattern is a far-field quantity but can be near-field. Very often, only the relative amplitude is plotted, normalized to the total radiated power. The plotted quantity may be shown on a linear scale, or in dB.
* [Radiation Intensity][46] - Some times called the radiation power density, is describes the power density that an antenna creates in a particular solid angle. A solid angle is a section of the surface of the imaginary sphere around the antenna. Its measurement units are watts per square meter.
* [Antenna Directivity][24] - This is a measures the power density the antenna radiates in the direction of its strongest emission, versus the power density radiated by an ideal isotropic radiator radiation pattern - directional characteristics.
* [Antenna Efficiency][25] - Also called "radiation efficiency", this is a measure of the efficiency with which a radio antenna converts the radio-frequency power accepted at its terminals into radiated power.
* [Antenna Gain][26] - Often called "power gain" or simply "gain", combines the antenna's directivity and electrical efficiency.  This figure describes how well the antenna converts input power into radio waves headed in a specified direction.
* [Polarization][47] - The polarization of an antenna is the orientation of the electric field (E-plane) of the radio wave with respect to the Earth's surface.
* [Antenna Bandwidth][48] - Antenna bandwidth is the range of frequencies within which the performance of the antenna, with respect to some characteristic, conforms to a specified standard. The bandwidth can be viewed as the frequencies left and right of the center frequency (usually the resonant frequency) in which the antenna performance meets the specified values.

An in depth and rigorous description of the key antenna parameters can be found in these documents:

* [NEC-2 Manual, Part III: User’s Guide](http://www.nec2.org/other/nec2prt3.pdf)

It is also important to note that the receiving characteristics of an antenna are equivalent to the transmitting characteristics.
This electromagnetic fact, call [reciprocity][27], means we can state the antenna's properties
independently of its uses as a transmitter or receiver.

## Discone Antenna
A discone antenna is a version of a [biconical antenna][19] is typically a wired structure,
its usually mounted vertically, with the disc at the top and the cone beneath.
The open litature discribes it as omnidirectional,
vertically polarized and with gain similar to a [dipole antenna][20], it is exceptionally wideband,
offering a frequency range ratio of up to approximately 10:1.
The radiation pattern in the horizontal plane is quite narrow, making its sensitivity highest in the direction of the horizon and rather less for signals coming from relatively close by.
A vertical whip may be affixed to the center of the disc in order to extend the low frequency response,
but this may compromise efficiency at higher frequencies.
In this configuration, at lower frequencies the discone may more closely resemble a ground plane antenna or a coaxial dipole.

As stated earlier, my aim is pickup frequencies around 115 Mhz+ is where planes and other air traffic services tend to broadcast.
We can expect the antenna size to increase if we attempt to reach lower frequencies.
Also, we are limited on the upper frequencies because of the 10:1 bandwidth typical for discone antennas.
With this lower bound, a discone could reasonably up to 1.15GHz.
Now this antenna bandwidth doesn't fully cover what the RTL-SDR can reasonable cover, which is [24MHz to 1850MHz][44].
We'll need to prioritize what frequencies we wish to go after or create multiple antennas,
but for now, we'll stick with one antenna.
We'll use this 115MHz to 1.15GHz starting point for the analysis
and perturb our parameters based on a more complete analysis.

## Discone Antenna Initial Design
I'll use the [Discone Antenna Calculator][45] to establish our baseline design.
Using this tool, I get the following results:

![Discone Dimensions](img/posts/jekyll-posts/discone-dimensions.jpg, "xxx")
![Discone Measurements](img/posts/jekyll-posts/discone-measurments.png, "xxx")

## Electromagntic Numerical Analysis
We would like to solve [Maxwell's equations][28] for the discone antenna design to discover its radiation pattern, etc.
Solving these equations as a [closed-form expression ][29] is hopeless except for the simplest types of antenna structures. 
So we'll need to leverage [numerical methods][30] to perform the analysis of the discone antenna.
An online search for suitable tools produces multiple possibilities.
Because of its popularity and [respect amoung the Ham Radio community][33] and others,
I have focused on the [Numerical Electromagnetic Code (NEC)][31] family of tools.
It is based on a numerical solution of electromagnetic ﬁeld integrals for thin,
perfectly conducting wire segments using the [Method of Moments (MoM)][32].
It was developed at Lawrence Livermore Laboratories, and remains widely used,
despite the old fashioned punched card style input required.
Like all tools, it has it limitations.
One major limitation (but not for this analysis) is that it can model antenna's
structured out of wire but not solid structures.
Also, the tool may have difficulties in converging or accurately modeling antennas with complex shapes
(not clear if we should be concerned).

There are at least four generations of NEC, with NEC2 being the highest version of the code within the public domain.
A translation of NEC2 into C, is called NEC2C, and when given a GTK+ based GUI, called Xnec2c.
There is also nec2++, which is a port of NEC2 to C++, with a C/C++ interface and python bindings.
There also exist many variations of these versions of NEC and multiple specialized implementations and supporting tools.
A good starting point to navigate this confusion is the [Numerical Electromagnetic Code NEC2 unofficial home page][34]
and [The unofficial Numerical Electromagnetic Code (NEC) Archives][35].

I'll be using Xnec2c since it is is a [GTK+][37] graphical interactive version of nec2c and well suited for my Linux system.
It incorporates the nec2c core, which it uses for reading input files and calculating output data,
but it produce an output in graphical format by default. 
The latest version of Xnec2c appears to be 2.3 and can be obtained from [here][36]
(Note: The Ubuntu / Debian packages appear to be version 1.4).
This package also includes many example input files and you can get more at [Steve Conklin's GitHub site][38].
From [here][36] I downloaded `xnec2c-2.3-beta.tar.bz2` into `~/src/xnec2c/` and proceed to do an install
as follows (You'll find very detail installation instructions in the file `INSTALL`):

```
cd ~/src/xnec2c
sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev libghc-gtk-dev
tar xvjf xnec2c-2.3-beta.tar.bz2
cd xnec2c-2.3-beta
./configure
make
sudo make install
make clean
git clone https://github.com/sconklin/Antenna-Modeling.git
cp Antenna-Modeling/dumpnec/dumpnec ~/bin
```

>**Note:** During the initial run of the `./configure` step, I discovered that my system didn't have GTK+ installed.
So the first step above is for installing the required libraries.
When completed, the executable is located at `/usr/local/bin/xnec2c`
The 2nd to last line is to get additional example input files from Steve Conklin's GitHub site.
The last line copies the `dumpnec` utility to my bin.
`dumpnec` is a pretty printer for NEC input files (very handy!).

To test xnec2c out, try one of the provided example input file, e.g. `xnec2c -i examples/13cm_Yagi.nec`.
To learn more about how to use xnec2c and create input files,
you'll need to tap into the documentation available for the multiple generations/versions of NEC software.
With a little bit of insight, you'll be able to leverage these "not quite xnec2c documentation" sources.
