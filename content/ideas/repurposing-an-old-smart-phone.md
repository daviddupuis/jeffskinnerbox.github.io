[Hack your Android phone (or Tablet)](http://www.instructables.com/id/Hack-your-Android-phone/?ALLSTEPS)

I recently purchased a new cell phone leaving me with a Samsung Galaxy S Captivate
([SAMSUNG-SGH-I897][16], [Android version 2.2 / Froyo / API level 8][15]) with no purpose in life.
I did a quick search of the web to get some ideas on how to re-purpose this smart phone
and I was intrigued by the following ideas: [remotely view and control your IP camera][03],
or [turn your phone into a IP camera][04],
or even [camera remote control][08],
[untethered navigation][05], 
[VoIP or video phone][06],
[emergency phone][07],
[garage/workshop intercom][09],
[home automation remote][10],
internet radio,
portable media player,
or a simple alarm clock.
But before venturing into these areas, the first task is to [root the phone][01]
and [flash its ROM][02] with the latest Android OS.
Strictly speaking, it may not be necessary to do all this to implement some of the ideas above,
but what the hell, this is what I want to do!

There are many sites that are useful in showing how to do the rooting and flashing.
The ones I leverage are:

* [Top 10 Reasons to Root Your Android Phone](http://lifehacker.com/top-10-reasons-to-root-your-android-phone-1079161983)
* [Everything You Need to Know About Rooting Your Android Phone](http://lifehacker.com/5789397/the-always-up-to-date-guide-to-rooting-any-android-phone)
* [How to Flash a ROM to Your Android Phone](http://lifehacker.com/how-to-flash-a-rom-to-your-android-phone-30885281)
* [Five Best Android ROMs](http://lifehacker.com/5915093/five-best-android-roms)

Given that I no longer have cellular service, I cannot install Apps via [Over-the-air programming (OTA)][11]
using the [Google Play][12] App on the phone.
There are alternatives to OTA called "side loading" and could be done via SDD card or the USB port.
I prefer the USB route and the following are helpful:

* [How To Manually Install (“Side Load”) Apps On Your Android Device](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-manually-install-side-load-apps-on-your-android-device/)
* [3 Ways to Install Applications On Android Without The Market](http://www.maketecheasier.com/install-applications-without-the-market/)

* [How to install .apk file on Android phone or tablet](http://xmodulo.com/2013/01/how-to-install-apk-file-on-android-phone-or-tablet.html)
* [Installing applications to your Androïd phone from your computer using Mandriva](http://www.linux-wizard.net/2011/02/05/installing-applications-to-your-android-phone-from-your-computer-using-mandriva/)
* [Setting Up ADB/USB Drivers for Android Devices in Linux (Ubuntu)](http://esausilva.com/2010/05/13/setting-up-adbusb-drivers-for-android-devices-in-linux-ubuntu/)

The final challenge will be getting the Apps,
or [Android application package file (APK)][13], so they can be loaded into the phone via the USB.
When you use OTA or go to [Google's Play website][14], you never get to touch the APK file.
The following articles provide the know-how to get APK files:
