Maybe this is all you need for this post:
[Open Source Hardware](http://au.mouser.com/applications/open-source-hardware/)

This interactive site contains information on many of the latest open source hardware boards and accessories, including BeagleBone, Arduino, Netduino, STMicroelectronics Nucleo, Texas Instruments LaunchPad, and the Intel Galileo.

The site contains schematic diagrams, technical details, and compatible expansion boards for the most common OSHW boards.

The new site is project oriented, allowing developers to sort and select parametric data for the desired board requirements of their particular project.

Parameters include processor type and speed; number of analog and digital inputs; wireless options including WiFi and Bluetooth; USB ports including host, client, and/or OTG; video connectivity; and more.
