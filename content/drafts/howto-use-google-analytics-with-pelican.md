the WAN-IP address can be found by visiting a Web-based IP address lookup service like http://checkip.dyndns.org/ from any computer on the home LAN.
http://www.checkip.org/

Another way to identify the public IP addresses of routers, involves executing a ping or traceroute command. From inside a home network, the (DOS) command "ping -r 1" will send a message through the home router that will cause its IP address to be displayed. For example, "ping -r 1 www.yahoo.com" should result in a message like the following displayed on the command prompt:

 

Reply from 66.94.230.43: bytes=32 time=294ms TTL=56
Route: 209.179.21.76
...
In this example, the IP address after "Route:" (209.179.21.76) corresponds to the router WAN address.
