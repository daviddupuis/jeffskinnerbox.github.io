Title: cURL Cheat Sheet
Slug: curl-cheat-sheet
Status: hidden

[cURL][03] is a command line tool for getting or sending files using URL syntax.
cURL uses the client-side URL transfer library [`libcurl`][01],
it supports a range of common Internet protocols,
including HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, FTPS, SCP, SFTP, TFTP, LDAP, LDAPS, DICT, TELNET, FILE, IMAP, POP3, SMTP and RTSP.
cURL offers a [busload of useful tricks][02] like proxy support, user authentication,
ftp upload, HTTP post, SSL connections (i.e. https:), cookies, file transfer resume.

Basic use of cURL involves simply typing `curl` at the command line,
followed by the URL of the output to retrieve.
cURL defaults to displaying the output it retrieves to the standard output specified on the system.
Beyond this, cURL offers an boat load of [command line options][04] to get the effect your looking for.

## Download a Single File
The following command will get the content of the URL and display it in the STDOUT (i.e on your terminal).

```shell
curl http://www.centos.org
```

To store the output in a file, you an redirect it as shown below.
This will also display some additional download statistics.

```shell
 curl http://www.centos.org > $HOME/tmp/junk.html
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100 15201  100 15201    0     0  33988      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:-- 33930
```

You get the same result by using the `-o` option.
In this case the command is: `curl -o $HOME/tmp/junk.html http://www.centos.org`.
And to use the URL name as the filename to store the result,
use the command: `curl -O http://www.centos.org/index.html`
and the output will be in the current directory, in file `index.html`.

## Downloading Multiple Files
We can download multiple files in a single shot by specifying the URLs on the command line.

```shell
curl -O http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/index.html -O http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/gettext.html
```

This command will download both index.html and gettext.html
and save it in the same name under the current directory.

## Follow HTTP Location Headers
By default cURL doesnâ€™t follow the [HTTP Location headers][05] (also called Redirect0.
When a requested web page is moved to another place,
then an HTTP Location header will be sent as a Response and it will have where the actual web page is located.
For example, if you attempt to download the home page of my blog, you get

```html
curl www.jeffskinnerbox.me
<html>
<head><title>301 Moved Permanently</title></head>
<body bgcolor="white">
<center><h1>301 Moved Permanently</h1></center>
<hr><center>nginx</center>
</body>
</html>
``` 

To get the page, use the following

```shell
curl -L www.jeffskinnerbox.me
```

# Doing HTTP Request Methods With cURL
The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application protocol for distributed,
collaborative, [hypermedia][07] information systems.
HTTP functions as a request-response protocol in the client-server computing model. 
A web browser may be the client and an application running on a computer hosting a web site may be the server.
The client submits an [HTTP request message][08] to the server. 
This is also know as the client executing a HTTP Request Method.

cURL supports the `--request` (or `-X`) parameter,
you must choose our HTTP method to use for the requests.
Its values can be GET, POST, DELETE, PUT, etc.
If we don't specify this parameter, cURL will use the GET method by default.

## Make a GET Request Without Any Data
We have already been doing this in the above examples.
The following commands are equivalent:

```shell
curl http://www.centos.org
curl --request GET 'http://www.centos.org'
```

In the first line, cURL is using the GET method by default.

## Make a Request With Data
In order to send data with the GET requests, we should use `--data` parameter.
For example, you could send login data with POST request

```shell
curl --request POST 'http://www.somedomain.com/login/' --data 'username=myusername&password=mypassword'
```

Search for data

```shell
curl --request GET 'http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=my_keyword'
```

## Rake requests With Extra Headers
Sometimes you need to add [HTTP headers][09] to your requests.
This is done by `--header` parameter.

```shell
curl --request GET 'http://www.somedomain.com/user/info/' --header 'sessionid:1234567890987654321'
```

Notice that we are using semicolon(":") to separate header name from its value.

## Get Response With HTTP Headers
If you need to get HTTP headers with your response, `--include` parameter can be used.
[HTTP headers][10] are part of these HTTP requests and responses,
and they carry information about the client browser, the requested page, the server and more.
Consider the following to see what additional information is provided.

```shell
curl --request GET 'http://www.centos.org' > junk1
curl --request GET 'http://www.centos.org' --include > junk2
diff junk1 junk2
```

The `diff` produces the following:

```shell
0a1,10
> HTTP/1.1 200 OK
> Server: nginx/0.8.55
> Date: Sun, 27 Apr 2014 02:21:22 GMT
> Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
> Connection: keep-alive
> Last-Modified: Fri, 25 Apr 2014 13:49:41 GMT
> ETag: "20797-3b61-4f7de3cc22740"
> Accept-Ranges: bytes
> Content-Length: 15201
> 
```

## See Complete Request And Response Headers with CURL
Using verbose output in curl can help you see all headers
(both request headers sent and response headers received).
Using Verbose is done by simply passing `-v`.
For example, the command `curl www.youtypeitwepostit.com` gives you

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Home</title>
        <!-- optional styling to this site -->
        <link href="http://netdna.bootstrapcdn.com/twitter-bootstrap/2.2.2/css/bootstrap-combined.min.css" rel="stylesheet" />
    </head>
    <body>
        <div>
          <h1>You type it, we post it!</h1>
          <p>Exciting! Amazing!</p>
          
          <p class="links">
            <a href="http://www.youtypeitwepostit.com/messages">Get started</a>
            <a href="http://www.youtypeitwepostit.com/about">About this site</a>
            <!--<a href="http://www.youtypeitwepostit.com/login">Login via Example.net</a>-->
          </p>
        </div>
    </body>
    <!-- optional enhancement -->
    <script src="http://netdna.bootstrapcdn.com/twitter-bootstrap/2.2.2/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
    <script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.js"></script>
    <script src="http://www.youtypeitwepostit.com/script.js"></script>
</html>
```

But the command `curl -v www.youtypeitwepostit.com` gives you

```html

```

## Show Only Response Headers
Sometimes you only want to see the response headers returned by the server,
without seeing the actual response content.
In this case, use the `-I` option.

```
$ curl --request GET -I www.youtypeitwepostit.com
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html
Date: Mon, 28 Apr 2014 01:38:16 GMT
Etag: "c69b62faa34d53bed401282f35449700"
Last-Modified: undefined
Content-Length: 973
Connection: keep-alive
```

## Pass HTTP Authentication in cURL
Sometime, websites will require a username and password to view the content.
With the -u option, we can pass those credentials from cURL to the web server as shown below.

```shell
curl -u username:password URL
```

**NOTE:** The credentials are passed in the clear, unencrypted!

## Download Files from FTP Server
cURL can also be used to download files from FTP servers.
If the given FTP path is a directory,
by default it will list the files under the specific directory.

```shell
curl -u ftpuser:ftppass -O ftp://ftp_server/public_html/xss.php
```

The above command will download the xss.php file from the ftp server
and save it in the local directory.

```shell
curl -u ftpuser:ftppass -O ftp://ftp_server/public_html/
```

Here, the given URL refers to a directory.
So cURL will list all the files and directories under the given URL.

## Upload Files to FTP Server
Curl can also be used to upload files to the FTP server with -T option.

```shell
curl -u ftpuser:ftppass -T myfile.txt ftp://ftp.testserver.com
```

The above command will upload the file named myfile.txt to the FTP server.
You can also upload multiple files at a same time using the range operations.

```shell
curl -u ftpuser:ftppass -T "{file1,file2}" ftp://ftp.testserver.com
```

## Using a Proxy
We can specify cURL to use proxy to do the specific operation by using -x option.
We need to specify the host and port of the proxy.
For example

```shell
curl -x proxysever.test.com:3128 http://google.co.in
```

## Send Mail using SMTP Protocol
cURL can also be used to send mail using the SMTP protocol.
You should specify the from-address, to-address, and the mailserver ip-address as shown below.

```shell
curl --mail-from blah@test.com --mail-rcpt foo@test.com smtp://mailserver.com
```

Once the above command is entered,
it will wait for the user to provide the data to mail.
Once youâ€™ve composed your message, type "." (i.e. period) as the last line,
which will send the email immediately.

## Get Definition of a Word using DICT Protocol
You can use cURL to get the definition for a word with the help of [DICT protocol][06].
We need to pass a Dictionary Server URL to it.
There are many dictionaries are available, but you can list all the dictionaries using
`curl dict://dict.org/show:db` and you get the output

```shell
220 pan.alephnull.com dictd 1.12.0/rf on Linux 3.0.0-14-server <auth.mime> <18508651.19610.1398478389@pan.alephnull.com>

To query for the word "internet", you get the following:

```shell
