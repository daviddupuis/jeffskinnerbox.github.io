Andrew McAfee and Erik Brynjolfsson, from MIT's Center for Digital Business, have a new book out called,
The Second Machine Age: Work, Progress, and Prosperity in a Time of Brilliant Technologies.
Its thesis: If the first machine age was about the automation of manual labor and horsepower, the second machine age is about the automation of knowledge work, thanks to the proliferation of real time, predictive data analytics, machine learning and the Internet of Things -- an estimated 200 billion devices connected to the Internet by 2020, all of them generating unimaginable quantities of data.

We have a software defined tommarow.

#### What's Really New Here?
Hobbyists have made custom things for a long time.
Evidence is in ham radio, RC modelling, Heathkit.
The first step in making a thing, even a non-physical thing, is visualizing it.
Computers can greatly aid that visualization, including sketching, drawing, simulation, analysis, and prototyping.
A most effective step in refining/developing a thing is collaborating with others on it.
Internet can greatly aid that collaboration.
Digital repositories are especially useful where data is used to directly reproduce objects and their derivatives.
