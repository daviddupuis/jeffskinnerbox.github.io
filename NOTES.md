# Random Notes

## To Do
Read the following:

* [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/)
* [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
* [Google Webmasters Tools](https://www.google.com/webmasters/)
* [Google Guidelines](http://www.feedthebot.com/)
* [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/intl/en/analytics/)
* []()

To test out the web site, use the command `jekyll serve --watch --drafts`
and then go to `http://localhost:4000/`.

## Licensing
I have opted to go with the [MIT License][01]. 
This seems like an important decision
(at least its important to keep the lawyers away from your door),
but how does one make the call?
I found the following sites useful:

* [Choosing an OSS license doesnâ€™t need to be scary](http://choosealicense.com/)
* [OSS Watch - Open Source Software Advisory Service](http://oss-watch.ac.uk/apps/licdiff/)
* [Open Source Initiative](http://opensource.org/licenses)
* [Unlicense](http://unlicense.org/)
